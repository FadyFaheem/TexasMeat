# TexasMeat
The official repo for Texas Meat iOS App.

## What is this?
Texas Meat is an app developed using Swift and CoreML. The use case for Texas Meat is using machine learning to find the best meat using image itteration and give a customer the best experience.

## Why do I think this project will work?
Sadly, in our day and age we're getting lazier. Technically no one should benfit of that, but sadly in our world it happens. My goal is to create a better, or even healthier food choice by giving what meat will cook best depending on the way it looks, and how the meat is identfied by.

## What is the end goal of this project?
It's mainly for use in my portfolio, but I also want to see this used in the real world. 

Main goals though that I'd target are as the following-

- Create better food decisions by a click of a image
- Create a user-friendly app that is not only enjoyable, but quick and responsive
- Let lazy people have better decisions and faster decisions.


## The end of the trail
I'm not sure how high my expectations are going to be for such a project, But I'd love to see how far I can go with having something that would be fun and enjoyable plus have something as a great carrer starting point with. I wish myself the best luck and through the deepest endavours.
